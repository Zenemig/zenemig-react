# Zenemig.net

This is my personal website, used as a portfolio for my work as a Front-End Developer and also as a showcase for some of the photos I take.

I both designed and developed this site using Figma, Visual Studio Code, Github, Netlify and Next.js. The previous version of this site had a similar design, but was done with VueJS. This iterations point was to improve the whole photography side but also to learn about Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
